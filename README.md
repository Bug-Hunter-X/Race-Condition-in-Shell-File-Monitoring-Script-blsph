This repository demonstrates a race condition in a shell script that monitors a file for changes.  The script `bug.sh` continuously checks for the existence of `/tmp/my_file.txt` and prints its contents. The issue arises when the file is updated while the script is reading, leading to inconsistent or corrupted data. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.sh`, utilizes flock to prevent race conditions during file access, ensuring data integrity.
